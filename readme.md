<!-- name -->
Curly braces - a project about data structures and algorithms.

<!-- descriptipon -->
This project had two main reasons:

Learning data structures and algorithms by explaining the basic principles and coding out example snippets;
Deepening my knowledge of full stack apps.

<!-- things learned -->
Data structures and their implementation from scratch(stacks, queues, linked lists, binary trees);
Algorithms, their implementation from scratch, comparison, explanation why some are better than others(sorting algorithms, 
search algorithms, binary tree traversal methods);
Deeper backend knowledge, MVC principle(express middleware, password encoding, communication between client and server, ...).
